<div class="panel">
<p>In this class, we're gonna talk about how to research career options and think about how you fit in organizations, which are the context in which our careers can flourish. Cuz we need companies and we need organizations to be able to do the work we wanna do. So the agenda for this class looks like follow.</p>
<p>First we talk about our approach how we think about it, some of the key terms and frameworks that we're using activities within an organization. So how does work get organized types of organization? Cuz that context is really going to change how that work gets deployed and then functions and industries.</p>
<p>Cuz those are gonna be the groupings of either activities or. Categories of service which again will affect the kinda work that we do and will align to our values and interests and things we wanna be doing. And then how do we find our fit? How do we merge those things about us with the place we want to go?</p>
<p>Cause really the intention here is to identify your ideal fit within an organization, function and industry. So it can really give you that fulfilling and exciting work. All right. So with that, let's go ahead and jump into the. So let's kick things off with TE's approach to thinking about career exploration.</p>
<p>Before we dive into our broader approach, let's think about where this class sits in the career exploration process, which is in those career options and fit. Cause once we're clear on our values and our interests, then we want to think about how do those match with the context, the employer that we want to be at to keep driving our career.</p>
<p>And then once we get past this, then we'll look at how we analyze those and then build the plan and go get them. A key term in this class is organization. We're intentionally not calling it company or business. Cuz it's about this idea of a collective of individuals working towards a common goal.</p>
<p>That goal might be to make money. It might be for a nonprofit or a cause. And it's important that we frame it that way. So you can think about the context and the collective that you wanna be a part of. So that's why we use the word organization and that's how we define it. And what we're really after in this class is thinking about you, the organization and the ideal fit.</p>
<p>Cause what we're not really talking about is starting companies right now. You're gonna wanna think about how you shape the organization if you eventually pursue more entrepreneurial endeavors. But really what we're focused on is what is that context that we can be within that really.</p>
<p>Excites us energize us and moves us towards that fulfilling work. And so we're calling that ideal fit the intersection of that ven diagram. And the way we start to do that is we look at our skills, our abilities, our energizers, our potentials. The organization, they have functions in an industry and where those intersect is at that function industry.</p>
<p>We've got things we wanna be doing, skills, crafts, disciplines, abilities, those tend to align to a function. I want to do data analysis. There's probably a function called data analysis. Or that might be within the function of marketing, doing marketing operations. And then the industry might align with my values.<p>
<p>If there are things that I care a lot about with the Eva, the environment and impact, there may be industries that make that a little tricky. So what we wanna do is find that ideal fit of the things that matter to us, the things that matter to the organization, function in industry is really gonna be where they come together.</p>
<p>Getting aligned with that work that really brings us that fulfilling work. So what we wanna do is really focus on learning about organizations and functions and to help us explore our career options. Cuz again, companies. Are the kind of soil for our career. If the company is not rich with opportunity and we don't understand how it operates in the context in which it exists, it's gonna hinder our ability to grow and to pursue the things that we want to do.</p>
<p>All right. So with that, let's go ahead and jump into the first section of the class.</p>
<p>In this section, we're gonna focus on the activities within an organization. And we're gonna talk about it in this abstract way, because that'll help us think about the kinds of things we want to do and what fills our day with tasks and work.</p>
<p>And so we've got this framework that we call the four GS and it's a way to bucket the activities within an organization. And we would argue that we generally have a bias towards one of these clusters of activities that, that excites us and that we want to be a part of. And so we wanted to put a language around that and talk about how companies think about these clusterings of activities.</p>
<p>And first we'll look at goods and we're using these words that are generic because we'll talk about. How they get instantiated in different organization types. So goods are the products or services that the company sells, right? It might be labor in the form of hours. If you think of like a law firm or it may be a product it might be a widget, a physical good, or it may be a digital service, but the goods part of the business is what's focusing on making the things that people buy.</p>
<p>Then the next is growth, right? There is usually a part of the organization that is focused on taking those goods to market. And again, every company's a little bit different. So what we're trying to do is generalize these activities. So you can think about what part of the organization you wanna work on.</p>
<p>So growth is gonna be functions like, sales, marketing, it's those activities within an organization that help get the goods. In the hands of customers and get them to transact. And the third is gears without the gears, the business won't run, but oftentimes companies are gonna invest in that in a different way.</p>
<p>So when we think about gears, think about that kind of plumbing and infrastructure for a company that it absolutely requires to operate. It's a focus on the business itself. And then there's a fourth one that. Spans all of them and it's general, and this is an important one to look at, cuz if you're a person who really wants to touch all parts of the business, you have aspirations to be a CEO general manager.</p>
<p>That's where general falls. You're gonna need to understand all three of them. And typically people will come up through one of the three main pillars and then get to that place of general. But you might very early on in your career say, look, I want to be a generalist. I like being, thin and broad.</p>
<p>Rather than deep and narrow. And so that's why we added this fourth one when we were first coming up with the framework of general, cuz there are, people that fall into that category that want to touch all three. And so between those four, now you've got an understanding of the kinds of activities that happen in organization, broadly, but I would say it covers the majority of the activities within an organization.</p>
<p>Another thing to think about as you, pursue companies and opportunities is ha the size of a company, because the bigger the company, the more these categories of activities. Become discretized the smaller the company, the more they blend and the more that people have to wear multiple hats, someone may be doing marketing and product work.</p>
<p>What it's important to recognize is that you are wearing those two hats. And the more that you can have clarity on those, the better you can understand those occupation and those functions and the expectations of them. And so as companies mature and scale, That specialization becomes more and more I part important and more granular.</p>
<p>So that's the last part of the way that we think about these four GS and the way that organizations operate. And as you think about the kind work that you want to do, you can process, do I wanna be doing many things and touching a lot? So that either puts me in the general or working at smaller companies where I can touch a lot of things or do I want.</p>
<p>Deep knowledge and deep expertise in one of these categories of making the products, taking them to market, selling them or helping the business or even the department operate in a better way. And so that'll help you think about the goods gears growth in general. So with that, we'll go ahead and wrap up this section and move on to the next one.</p>
<p>In this section, we're gonna talk about types of organizations. In the previous section, we talked about the activities that happen in an organization. Now, here, we're gonna talk about a broad clustering of types of organizations to help us think about how those activities then get invested in. And one of the key drivers here is how a company makes its money, money at the end of the day is the lifeblood for a company. And so without money, it can't really. Operate in the commercial world that we exist in. And so looking at how a company derives its revenue and where its expenses go, will help us think about how they invest in talent and how they value it, which will ultimately affect you.</p>
<p>And so we put companies into these three meta buckets, whether product service or causes product companies rely on IP, which is intellectual property. They make a widget or a product. And what that typically means is that they have to make the product first and then they can sell it. So that's gonna require some level of investment.</p>
<p>How they derived. It might be through venture capital, but they've got a product and it can extend, beyond the hours in the day. And so examples of that might be like salesforce.com. Facebook sells advertising, Casper sales mattresses. They make a thing and they sell the thing.</p>
<p>When we think about services, really what we're talking about here is labor, right? Not web services, those are a product they're extending data, or, a subscription, really what we're using here, how we're using the word services is we're thinking about labor man hours. So if you think about.</p>
<p>Firms like law firms or consulting businesses or architecture firms. They may package their services in a one time fee or something like that. But at the end of the day, they're deriving their profit margins and how they make money by labor and the number of hours that go into things because they can't really extend that, beyond you know, human powered service.</p>
<p>And then lastly, we would say causes and causes make their money. Typically through donation, they may have a form of revenue and have ways to monetize the company. But they're usually not profit driven. A lot of causes might be nonprofits or universities, and there's lots of really interesting models for new.</p>
<p>Benefit driven companies, but they may not be as profit driven. So we put them as a third category because the way that they invest in the talent might be different. And which would obviously affect the way that you would think about your values and your priorities as you go into one of these organizations.</p>
<p>I. And so here's some examples that we wanna look at, take Google as an example, their product might be Gmail there's services. Here we put Google cloud services, probably a little confusing with the language, but I wanted to show that they probably have a consulting business that really helps deploy those.</p>
<p>And that a lot in enterprise models and then they also have causes, they have google.org. So some companies really have all of them. And if we think about, examples, Someone's primarily consulting like Accenture. They also have product solutions that they've grown through acquisition.</p>
<p>IBM is another very good example of a company. That's, that's got all three of these. So when you're looking at companies, you wanna see what part of the organization do you fall into and then, do they really value in it? Is it where they make their primary revenue? Especially when a company has multiple.</p>
<p>Be mindful of what the primary source of revenue is, cuz that's gonna shape how they invest in it, how they think about it. When the economy makes big changes, you'll see how they invest in those. So it's really important that you be mindful of these things to help you think about how organizations run and invest in talent.</p>
<p>In this section, we're gonna focus on functions and industries. Let's go ahead and define those terms cuz they may be a little bit abstract. A function is a grouping of skills and expertise within an organization. Some companies might be functionally organized or regionally organized or product organized, but they will have an understanding of how abilities and skills cluster.</p>
<p>And so we're gonna talk through that and that ultimately affects like where job sits with an organization. And so knowing these functions and how companies think about them is really important. When we look at an org chart for a company, and this is a, a schematic of a diagram for what an org chart can be.</p>
<p>But when you think about the. There's the top level executives, and then you're gonna have like your CMO, CDO, COO CFO, COO. And that is really emblematic of a function. A CMO is a chief marketing officer. And so what that is showing is the company drawing boundaries around. All activities having to do with marketing, because they want an expert leading those activities.</p>
<p>Now, some companies may distribute that regionally and make like a regional CMO, or they may have all the marketing people report into a region. And, that's getting into do dotted line and solid line relationships, which we're not really gonna cover here, but when a company has functions, what they are saying is we are clustering activities and the bigger the company.</p>
<p>Probably the more granular they get with a function. So let's talk through an example of that, right? If we look at the high level activities of growth goods and gears, There tends to be a mapping. It's not always a hundred percent, but generally the functions fall into those buckets where growth is like sales and marketing things that are revenue related, they help grow the business goods, technology, product consulting.</p>
<p>Those are things that they sell. And then the gears, operations, finance, HR, legal, the business needs them to. And so that's pretty coarse and the smaller the company, the more that a person might have a broad remit, but then the bigger the company, then you layer on resolution. So let's go down the growth passive you.</p>
<p>If you go to marketing. Then marketing might break up into acquisition marketing, content, marketing, digital marketing, brand marketing and different companies are gonna organize this in different ways. It might be earned. It might be organic. It might be paid. They're gonna have different ways of clustering it, but it's all really going up to marketing.</p>
<p>And what we see this tends to have a pretty high mapping, two job titles. So if we go down one level, then we'll look at different kinds of content. Let's say. Email marketing, video, marketing, social media, marketing, influencer marketing event marketing. And that might go into a director of content.</p>
<p>And as you see these levels, you'll see. And you look at opportunities. You'll see that they tend to map to seniority. Let's go one level down, this would be at a very big company, but they might have someone whose full time job is to focus on Twitter. And, maybe they cluster a few of these, it's like someone gets Twitter and LinkedIn and Pinterest, and then someone else takes Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>And so what you'll see is that the bigger the organization, the finer, the resolution, or the more granular functions might get. And when you think about this. It starts to present what career Ascension and growth could look like for you. If you're able to map out the organization and how they think of the nesting of functions, there is no standard for functions, which makes it annoying.</p>
<p>But if you look at job descriptions that are posted on a company, you might be able to start to discern how they think about their functions and how they organize the nesting of those functions. And so what that translates to is like the level within that function, again, we're using the language of resolution, so that low resolution might be marketing technology, human resources.</p>
<p>One tip here is to look at C titles that tends to be the lowest resolution of a function. If a company has created a C title, being a chief marketing chief technology, At the corporate leadership level. That's telling you, that's like the apex of the org chart. And that is the courses way that they're thinking about it.</p>
<p>Some companies, if it's an important category to them, they may, peel it off. So as an example, chief brand officer chief communications, officer chief marketing officer one could argue that those are all various forms of marketing. So I would look to see reporting structures and how the company does that.</p>
<p>If a company has you. A lot of communications priorities. They may make it its own C title, but understanding those things are really valuable because then they help you understand how you would grow within that company. Then you could look to see how do they ladder down. So within marketing, as content marketing, what are the symbolic titles that tied to that?</p>
<p>Are they directors? Are they VPs? How does the company think about it? And then what are, what is one level down from that, which we would say high resolution and what you see there is that those probably start to map directly to job descriptions. And so that's what we think. These functions are really important.</p>
<p>And even though the company may not be explicitly thinking about it as functions, it is more often than not implicitly. So the more that you UN have that understanding of the organization, the way they think about it, the better you'll be able to plan out your career growth and which functions map to your skills, cuz that's again what we said at the beginning is that what functions are, is clusterings of skills and abilities.</p>
<p>So if you've got these skills and that you're excited about by identifying the function, that's gonna show you where you can exercise those skills and build. And so here, you're starting to see those two worlds come together because certain functions are gonna have more or less requirements of a particular skill.</p>
<p>Now it's not always one to one, cuz these skills can recontextualize. So let's take research. For example, within product design, you've gotta have research abilities. But also in sales, you've gotta research. And on more of the gear side on administration, you've also gotta be able to do research and let's take a skill like negotiation event, marketing, procurement, employment, law, all of those require the negotiation skill.</p>
<p>So a skill doesn't always map one to one to an occupation. Many skills are actually extensible and can exist in different contexts. So then what you wanna do is think about which of those functions allow you to pursue those skills and grow those skills. And the cool thing is that there's always expanding functions.</p>
<p>This is not a fixed thing. And that's part of the reason that there's no standard for it. So what I look for is what are these up and coming C titles, right? You're getting chief diversity inclusion, chief content, officer, chief data, officer chief culture officer. Some of these go away chief sustainability officer was very common for a little while.</p>
<p>Now you're seeing a little bit less of it because companies just think that's the way they should operate. And maybe it doesn't warrant a C title. So looking at how companies frame their C titles, give them out. Keep them. We'll tell you which functions are up and coming. Sometimes functions start to converge.</p>
<p>There's a chief growth officer that's coming about and people converging or companies I should say, converging product and marketing or sales and marketing under one organization. And so those might be some clues to show you how functions are evolving and what's a little more current. Industry is oftentimes a really tricky word because industries can change.</p>
<p>There are standardized industries. The EU has one and there's different organizations within the us that have like the bureau of labor statistics, cuz they want to categorize industry, but now that's becoming more and more complicated. So we think about it as a way for you to group organizations based on the markets that they serve.</p>
<p>But really it's a taxonomy that you can use for yourself to align to your interests and the domains that you wanna be a part of. And it's really important cuz companies value domain or industry knowledge, sometimes independent of occupation or functional knowledge. So let's talk about that a bit more.</p>
<p>When we talk about an industry we're talking about, collective efforts to solve a similar market. And so that is an ability to have domain knowledge on what that market is required to do. And hopefully that domain is one that's of interest to you. It aligns with your values and the kind of work that you wanna be doing somewhat independent of the occupation, craft and function.</p>
<p>So some examples of industries, transportation, technology, healthcare, hospitality, entertainment, real estate. The tricky thing is that they are not so obvious. Let's take a company like Uber. Is it transportation or is it technology a company like Amazon? Is it retail or is it technology? And really what we would say is they're more like tags than exact categories and use them as a way to organize organizations for yourself to target these domains that you're excited about.</p>
<p>And when companies get big enough, Industry's really not that helpful because they could be operating in many industries. So be mindful of industries that you've got experience in. And if you could leverage it or experience that you want to be a part of and seeing if there's parts of organization that, that engage in those industries.</p>
<p>You also wanna be mindful of how industries are affected by current events. So looking at what C's done, obviously the retail industry and it's really the physical retail industry was clearly affected travel as an industry. You might call that hospitality all of those things are affected.</p>
<p>So what I would say with industries is that they have a really important. Part to play in like the economic viability in the moment. And that is the kinds of thing that's changing all the time. Cuz some industries may come and go given new technological advances or changes in market dynamics.</p>
<p>So that's where industry is also really important to help you think about your career growth and where those opportunities are gonna be presented. Given the broader global dynamic. Some industries that are really thriving and seeing a big boost from the world we're living in now are things like collaboration, technology, right?</p>
<p>Working from home and remote meetings. Those probably wouldn't have grown at the rate that they are had the world not. Experience what it's experiencing. So another good example is home fitness delivery, last mile logistics, eCommerce. And so as you think about your career growth, it is good to approach this kind of like an investor and think about what industries are gonna thrive, because those are gonna be the companies that are opening up roles.</p>
<p>They're gonna be hiring more aggressively. They're gonna need to fill a lot of seeds and they'll probably have a higher appetite for bringing on people with an excitement and energy about their industry. And so bringing it all together is skill, function and industry. And these are the things you want to think about as you explore these new career opportunities, cuz the skill might be building relationship.</p>
<p>That's a pretty good match for the sales function, but then the industry that you do that in would be very different. So you might be a person who's done sales and good at building relationships, but you're coming from the media industry and selling advertise. And now you want to go into pharmaceuticals cuz you may be moved to a geography where that's a, a flourishing market.</p>
<p>And so all these things come together and they really affect your ability to get hired and do that work cause companies want to hire you for what you did, not what you wanna do. So the more you can frame your value to the market in this way and being mindful. Of the value you bring the easier it's gonna be to get hired and do these opp, and pursue these things that excite you and fulfill you.</p>
<p>And, are that work that you're excited about doing? So here's some examples, right? Let's take the function, social media. Here's three very different ways that it could come to be. If you are in the transportation industry, working at a company like lift, you might call that technology, but you're gonna need to be able to engage in topics of transportation and understand that's the market.</p>
<p>You sit within, maybe it's hospitality, right? Understanding hotels, and what's going on with that market. Or it could be a nonprofit. And so here, what you're seeing is a product business, maybe more of a service business. And a cause business. And so here you see a couple other functions and a couple other ways that they could come to be.</p>
<p>And so that's why we think the intersection of function industry and organization is how you really think about that context in which you can deploy your skills, abilities, and values and get that work that really excites you</p>
<p>in this section. We wanna bring the class all together and thinking about how you fit with the organization.</p>
<p>First thing we wanna look at is. Are you a generalist? Are you a special. Do you want to be a generalist or do you want to be a specialist? Both have value. Specialists might have a bit of an easier time communicating their value. Cuz a lot of times companies want a very specific thing, but that's not, that's not to discount or devalue generalists.</p>
<p>There's a lot of opportunities for generalists and there's a lot of research that shows being a generalist can add a ton of value for the organization and can be a very. Enriching and fulfilling career. So having an opinion on that is, is really important for you, as you think about the kind of work that you wanna.</p>
<p>Then you wanna think about the level of seniority you want? A lot of people think that they need to manage and they need to lead to make more money and that's not always true. What's really important. That is that the work that you do is fulfilling exciting and you can be really good at it.</p>
<p>And then you can prioritize the values like income or balance or the things that matter. So thinking about. Whether you're an individual contributor, which means, you're really rolling up your sleeves, you're doing the work. It's gonna be quite granular and technical. You're doing the, and technical one, I mean is more technique than technology.</p>
<p>So you are doing the sales, you are doing the marketing, you are doing the coding. Then we go to manager, which means you're starting to manage people. And you're starting to spend the bulk of your time on helping people be productive and helping the company get the most value from those people, which means their growth and them having fulfilling work so that everybody benefits.</p>
<p>And then last is strategic leader, which I would say like a manager of managers. So now you are managing people that are managing people, helping setting, set the objectives, the vision for the company, probably starting to have more of a broad remit around. Profit and loss and budget and things like that.</p>
<p>And sure, there is usually a sort of mapping to career growth within a company with the more you move up, but it's, we wanna make sure that we emphasize that's not always the case. And if you pursue, management and leadership, Because you think it results in growth, but you don't have a genuine interest in doing it that can lead to less fulfillment, drained, and unhappiness with work.</p>
<p>And there's absolutely a case to be made for depth and really going deep in your craft with seniority. And a lot of companies have done some very cool things to make that possible. So that's something you wanna look out for. They don't always have to go, up into management to be able to grow your career.</p>
<p>And so here's some examples of how that context might change. Let's take the craft or the discipline or function of recruiting, you could recruit. In house. So that means you're in the gears part of the organization, or you could recruit at a search firm or a head hunting firm or recruiting firm.</p>
<p>The difference here is when you're recruiting in house you're a cost center. You're in the gears. When you're in a recruiting firm, you are the goods. You're the labor that makes money. And so the company is going to invest in that in a different way, but it's also gonna require different skills of you.</p>
<p>Again, using that same example, when you're at a search firm, you're probably re responsible for going out and getting clients where if you're in the gears, you don't need to do that. You really just get need to, I shouldn't say just, but the focus of your role is on attracting talent to come work at this company.</p>
<p>You're really excited about. Where, when you're doing it as a search firm, you gotta go first, get companies to be excited to hire you. So you gotta do sales and then you gotta go get them talent. And so the context is gonna have a big impact on the skills required to succeed in a role. And so that's something we want to think about, how that company makes their money, what's that function.</p>
<p>And then how those come together are going to affect the requirements on you to be able to do that. If you want to start to explore functions and see what's possible, we highly recommend you go to the functional channels within slack. There's a lot of people there really excited to talk about their function grant, informational interviews and in, in career commons the functional channels are there.</p>
<p>You just search for them. And then in career council, we also have the functional channels where you can have more long form discussion and people are more than happy to do informational interviews. As you're exploring possibilities. What you really want to do is understand those industries a and the occupations.</p>
<p>And so you wanna look at what are the issues that companies are solving? What are the issues you're excited about? What's the work environment like what's the work setting? Does it align with your values? What are the skills required? What are the responsibilities? And what's the outlook that really starts to tie to that market.</p>
<p>And. Is where is that market going? What are gonna be the demands on those occupations? As an example, a lot of digital marketing is really growing now. That is the way that people acquire customers, eCommerce and a lot of direct to consumer. So that's gonna mean there's a lot of career growth and new opportunities.</p>
<p>In those categories and the inverse is gonna happen. Certain categories are gonna be not as required. So like physical retail right now is not as required. We'll see, how that bounces back, but that's where you having an outlook on where the market is going and of thinking like an investor for your career could really have a lot of value and help you think about what that fit is for.</p>
<p>Ways that you can research this. There's lots of really good tools. You obviously reading business publications. The us government has things like career one stop the occupational outlook O net the us bureau of labor statistics. And there's this great site called Zia, which I'll show you in a minute.</p>
<p>That has a great career researching tool where you can look at functions, through education or through C. I know Zia has this great tool where you can look at occupations and then you can see what are industries that require it. What's general income ranges. What are, things that you need to do.</p>
<p>And also they'll show you what companies have open roles in that category at the moment. As you research companies, things you wanna look at are the size of the company. That's gonna again, show like how specific they're gonna get on the three GS or sorry, the four GS stage and age that's gonna affect how the company runs and their willingness to invest in new roles.</p>
<p>Their mission and values. How do those align with you, their product and services? Do they make something that you're excited about and you think you can contribute to location? Right now we're in a world where work from home and remote is very viable, but, think about. What that looks like for you.</p>
