<div class="panel">

<p>In this class, we're gonna talk about how to customize your resume. A lot of people think that they can make one perfect resume and send that to all companies. And. That's unfortunately just not the case and that's not gonna cut it anymore. Given technology and what people are looking for with the volume of people, applying to companies, you really need to stand out.</p>
<p>So that's what we're gonna cover in this class. There's a lot in here. So let me quickly give you an overview of the agenda. We're gonna talk about our approach and kind of the way we think about it. We're gonna talk about job descriptions and how they really are companies telling you. What they are looking for and what for you to look for when you dissect them and go through them, how you're gonna customize your resume and the kinds of things you're gonna do and how you can be efficient about that process, then cover letters and references for when you need them.</p>
<p>And then we'll do a little bit of a wrap up with some of the other things you can cover. With that, I'm excited to walk you through this class and in the upcoming section. We'll see you in the next section.</p>
<p>in this section, we're gonna talk about TE's approach to customizing your resume. And some of the things we've learned, helping thousands of job seekers and folks that are looking to grow their career and how we've shaped this class.</p>
<p>So one thing about the mindset and I think you'll hear a say a lot is that you are now a sales. And the product is you, right when we're out there. Sometimes it's tricky to be our own advocate. It's hard to sell. And you gotta think about all the things you've done, right? When you think about a product, you really love.</p>
<p>We go and tell everybody about it because they would benefit from using it. Or we find a restaurant that we love. We go and tell everyone about it. But when it comes to us saying things. I'm really good at, or I did this, it might feel like we're bragging or being conceded or arrogant. And obviously there's a difference between confidence and arrogance and a big part of growing your career and convincing people to take a bet on you is that confidence in yourself that you can do it.</p>
<p>So this mindset of you are a salesperson and the product is you. We buy products when we think they'll make our life better. you are a product and you're gonna make that company better. So really start to think about embodying this mindset of you are a salesperson and your product is you to be able to do that.</p>
<p>You need to tailor your offering per company. Cuz every company is looking for a different product. They might say product manager, marketing manager, but what every company wants is slightly different, right? They don't want. Idealized prototype of that role. So you need to understand what is that company looking for and you need to be the solution to their problem, right?</p>
<p>They've got a problem. They're posting a job and saying, these are all the things we need. These are all the requirements we expect. These are all the skills we want you to have. and you need to show that you've got them. You can't just show all these things that make you great, because if they only need half of them be like that's great.</p>
<p>That you're great, but we just don't need that. So you need to show how you are the answer to their prob to their problems, right? You need to show that you are the solution to their problems and the way you do that is by customizing your material. The job of the resume is to get you in the. The resume doesn't get you hired.</p>
<p>And so that's why it's so important that you spend time and energy on this document and showing how you are qualified for the job at this company. They post a job, you tailor your materials and you use that for your application. In another class, we talk about the various ways to apply whether someone refers you in, or you apply through the online portal, but no matter what the person making the decision will look at your resume, they'll have an understanding of what they need for the.</p>
<p>And the more, those two things match the higher likelihood that you're gonna be, get called in for an interview. And that's when you can really prove yourself and give your full story</p>
<p>in this section, we're gonna talk about job descriptions and the job description is a critical component of seeking out those opportunities to take your career to the next level.</p>
<p>Whether it's a job description within a company you already work at, or a job description for a company you're applying for the J. Oftentimes we'll outline exactly what you need now. Sure.</p>
<p>There are some that were hastily put together and don't give all the details, what let's give 'em the benefit of the doubt and say that document.</p>
<p>Is the blueprint for what they're looking for. So that's why you're gonna invest so much time and energy in really understanding them. So you can present yourself as the solution to the company's problem. Think about the RF as a think of the JD as like an RFP, request for proposals, that's what the company's doing. The company is putting an RFP out to the world and you are responding with your resume. All right. So let's talk about J. The job posting is the company telling you exactly what they're looking for. Again, sometimes they might have been copy and pasted from another job, or who knows what, but let's assume that requirement section, that expectation section is exactly what the company is looking for.</p>
<p>They're telling you whether you need to have a degree, they are telling you how many years of experience you need to have. They're telling you whether you've achieved a certain thing or not. They're telling you if you've partnered with other departments. So you really wanna understand that. Cause it's the company telling you what they are looking for.</p>
<p>Job descriptions generally have these four to six sections. There is no standard. They're all not done in the same way. So it's really on you to start to discern these. These are generally what you'll see in there. You'll see a heading that talks about the company and a bit of information. You'll usually see a company pitch telling you about why the company's great, cuz at the same time, as it being an RFP, it's also an advertisement, right?</p>
<p>They wanna get the best talent. So they're trying to hook you in. So there's that combination of saying this is what we need, but also selling themselves. So that's what that company pitch does. Then there's the roles and responsibilities. It talks about the role. then they'll usually do requirements or qualifications.</p>
<p>These are like their need to haves and then a little bit more of that selling and telling you about the company. So they'll talk about their benefits and perks and usually some compliance stuff, depending on the size of the company. So let's talk about those main four at the beginning.</p>
<p>Really? Cuz the bottom ones are a little bit more administrative and you probably wouldn't respond to them too much other than to learn more about the company. So the first step in analyzing JDS and it's a lot of work, but. copying and pasting them. You want to take that document and, or at least that job description that you saw, whether it's on a job board or on the company's side directly, so you can annotate it and you can start to add information to it and you can start to highlight all those things that matter.</p>
<p>We are big believers in fewer quality applications than, blasting out a whole bunch of low quality applications. So it's worthwhile to do this work, right? If you're gonna get a 10% conversion on, doing the big blast, you might get like 30, 40% conversion when you do this, very tailored work.</p>
<p>So it's worth the time and energy. So go ahead and copy the JD into Google docs or Microsoft word or pages or whatever word editing software you like, but go ahead and paste it. All right now, what you're gonna do is you're gonna start to dissect this thing and you're gonna look at the different sections.</p>
<p>So the heading and the company pitch, right? The heading is gonna tell you the job title is obviously super important, but job titles are all over the map. Some companies use titles to inflate the role others don't. So one thing we often recommend is go look at other job postings at that company and see how they're using titles.</p>
<p>Is it specific to that department? Is it specific to the whole company? But it'll give you a sense of like where it sits within the company, does this, does director mean a lot at this company or not, in some companies and in some industries, VP doesn't mean much and in others it's incredibly rare and hard to get.</p>
<p>So look at. next is when it was posted, right? When job posts start to get a little stale, they're probably not gonna be as attentive to applicants. Two to three weeks is the furthest. If a post has been out there for months, something's probably a little fishy. So pay attention to that.</p>
<p>then look to see where you sit in the organization, right? This is gonna help you do your research as you learn. So in this end you're part of the marketing team, right? Look for those cues. And if you could almost start to construct like a mental org chart of the company, that's super helpful.</p>
<p>And then look for some culture and tone and style, cuz that. affect the way you speak when you get the interview, how you write. So look out for those things and they talk about their goal and what they're trying to do and their mission as a company. And so that's the kind of stuff you'll see in the heading in the pitch.</p>
<p>Now the role is where they will paint like a broader picture of the expectation they're not getting into the nitty gritty of the details. So they might give you a few cues to like, what matters. In this case, retention, And, engagement are gonna be important and improve the experience of our members.</p>
<p>They use the word member, not customer, not user. So think about that and take that into account. And then what I consider like the JD honeypot is when they tell you who the role reports to you. Don't get that often, but it's wonderful because now you can go research that person you can learn about them.</p>
<p>You can learn about the kind of hires they've made, which will give you some kind of inclination of what they're looking for. So if you can get this role will report to that's really great, and always look out for that by title. Cause then you can go find that person online. Okay. Next is the responsibilities, right?</p>
<p>And again, not every JD is posted a little bit different, but this is what you're looking for. They might call it something different, but this is where they talk. , what the role would be looking for and what would be doing on a day in and day basis. And you're starting to see an explicit call out for the abilities that you need to.</p>
<p>you've managed a team. You've built a team strategy. You've used a CRM. They may do it broadly, like a term like CRM, or they might say Salesforce or HubSpot or a Marketo. And so you wanna look at that, cuz those are gonna be terms you're gonna wanna put into your resume. So when they use what's called the applicant tracking system to filter resumes, your terms came up.</p>
<p>So cause the way this process usually works is a hiring manager. We'll go to a recruiting team and they'll say, this is what I'm looking for. They will put this together, but then, the recruiting team needs to go find the people and vet people before it makes its way in. So they need to hone in on just a few key things that really matter.</p>
<p>And then they go deep. So that's what you're looking for here in responsibilities. And it's gonna be on you to prove that you've done this before. So that's why you wanna get these terms. And that's why we say you wanna respond to this JD. You wanna just talk about all the things you've ever done.</p>
<p>They are saying explicitly in this JD, this is what we need. And you wanna line these up one by one and knock 'em out and say that you've done them before then comes the qualifications or oftentimes, maybe requirements. and they're starting to say the things that are generally the kind of like deal breakers, right?</p>
<p>So 10 years of experience, that's not to say that you can't apply for this job with seven years of experience, with two, that might be a little hard. You're just gonna have to work harder to get those and, not just apply online and get someone to get you in and make your case.</p>
<p>But these tend to be. Pretty rigid. Again, you can definitely get past them, but this is the company telling you things. So you really wanna focus on the qualifications section and be mindful of if you don't meet any of these qualifications, what kind of work are you gonna do to make the case for them to hire you and for you to prove that even though you don't have the years, you are beyond capable of doing this.</p>
<p>So look out for these and you really wanna make sure that you address these in your resume. Once you've done that full analysis, your document will start to look something like this. You'll highlighted the keywords. You have all highlighted the parts that are most important because that's gonna be something you can go back to when you start to customize your resume.</p>
<p>And make sure that you address these one by one. And so you use this as a little bit of a plan, and the good thing is, as you do more of these, you'll go building out your master resume and they will be faster and faster to produce. You'll get better at identifying the things that matter. You're probably applying for roles that are similar and title and similar in responsibility.</p>
<p>So these things will start to overlap and you'll get a ton of reuse. So the first few might feel like a little bit of a S. But little by little you'll gain more efficiency and you'll be able to customize these applications very quickly, but your results will be much, much better. We've got a couple tools that can help you do this.</p>
<p>First and foremost is the teal job tracker. It's part of your teal membership. You get access to it. It's a tool to really help you manage the job searching process. Can. Incredibly painful and slow and take a lot of time. And you really gotta do a lot and do it well.</p>
<p>So we want to give you that. So I'll quickly walk you through this tool and how it works in case you haven't used it, but we won't take too much time on it. so couple ways to get to the teal job tracker right within the platform. If you go over to the tool section, you can search for it. It's called job tracker or it's one of our key features.</p>
<p>So it's right here in the job picker. If you go to job tracker, it'll pop you over to it. And if you haven't set it up before, you might go through like an initial onboarding that walks you through some things and how to set up the Chrome extension. But here is the job tracker fully filled out. Tina Miller's been using it for a while and we're really trying to keep it as close to a spreadsheet as possible.</p>
<p>Cause it's what a lot of us use to manage this, but layer on that additional information that makes it really powerful. So when. I click on a role. I start to be able to track things like the day that I applied. When do I wanna follow up by if I'm really excited by this role? And I can track where it is in the process as a premium feature, you gotta be a premium member to see this.</p>
<p>We will automatically highlight some of those skills for you, the hard and soft skills. Now it won't get a hundred percent, but it gets a fair amount of 'em and it can guide you in that right direction of the kinds of things that you would look for. In your custom resume, by default you'll just get the JD so you can copy and paste it quickly.</p>
<p>So you'll have that here. It just won't automatically highlight the keywords for you. You can also then start to add notes. You can add contacts as the people that you meet along the way. The. And little by little, we'll add more information, but the main thing is that you can then move it over to preparing, manage your funnel and start to get that ready.</p>
<p>So for this phase of the job search, that's really the main thing you'd want to use in the job tracker, but more broadly, you'll use it for a lot of other things. The other thing you want to make sure you're using is the Chrome extension. You'll wanna there's other videos on how to install it. It's pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>We'll walk you through it, but it is by far the biggest time saver. So let me show you how to use. so here I am on LinkedIn searching for jobs within the job search interface of LinkedIn and any job that I'm excited about. Let's say this job at Salesforce of marketing cloud, I use the teal Chrome extension.</p>
<p>It'll pull in the company, the name, information, the JD. I can add some notes right now. If I wanted save the job and I can either keep job searching or view it. Now let's go ahead and do. And here is the job right within the job tracker. Again, if you're a premium member, it'll automatically highlight the keywords for you and save you a bunch of time when you wanna make sure you address those in your resume, but otherwise the JD would be there without no keyword highlighting.</p>
<p>And so you have that all there for you and you can do everything else and move it over to preparing once you're ready to apply for this job the job tracker should save you really a bunch of time in that process. Let's jump back over to the present. So we just talked about the job tracker. It works with a bunch of sites beyond LinkedIn.</p>
<p>It works with indeed Glassdoor and honestly, every day we're adding more and more sites. Cuz the idea is to give you one central place to do this and look at it in the same format cuz every job board is different, but this will allow you to quickly jump through them. So again, highly recommend using the job tracker it's free.</p>
<p>It's included as part of your membership highly encourage you to get the premium features cuz it saves you a tremendous amount of time. But also you can very much do it by hand. If you wanted to. Another tool we highly recommend is a tool called job scan. It'll actually take your resume. And the job description and compare them for you, which is really cool.</p>
<p>And we don't currently have any features like that. And they do a really nice job. You can do one scan for free and then you can upgrade and they've got a different plan, so you can do it on a regular basis. It's just job scan.co you copy and paste your resume, copy and paste the job description.</p>
<p>And it'll do an analysis for you to get you really close. Cuz what it's trying to do is. What the applicant tracking system would be looking for. So again, highly recommend this tool. We've listed it on the page of the class itself and it's in the tool section. It's just a third party tool, not built by teal, but it's really wonderful.And we highly recommend it.</p>
<p>in this section. We're gonna talk about customizing your resume. This is where you really start to do a lot of work. In the last section, we talked about how to unpack a job Des. how to unpack a job description and how to use some tools to help you do that faster. Now you start to actually produce that resume.</p>
<p>So let's go ahead and dive in first, we recommend that you create a master resume, and this is a little bit of a new concept, right? Cuz oftentimes we'll make that one resume. We'll either use that one everywhere or we'll do that save as, and we'll continue to make different versions. What we are saying is do a little bit of extra work.</p>
<p>and create one document that has everything in it. It's an exhaustive document. This isn't the one where you're editing and curating and different versions of this is the one that's supposed to have everything. So every time you make a new achievement, you add it here, every job title or every permutation of a job title that you're excited about.</p>
<p>You add it here. If you've got different versions of your blurb, you add them. , we've got a template that you can use in the teal platform. If you go over to the tools and look at our templates, you can use this Google doc. If you'd like, or you can obviously make your own, you want this to be exhaustive and have everything.</p>
<p>We've got a working version of a teal application called the master resume or the resume builder. It's really focused on achievement building and having this one index and log of your career at the moment, it doesn't produce resumes. But it does give you a structured way to do it. And it's got a really great achievement wizard but you would have to then copy paste these one by one, into a more sort of beautifully formatted document.</p>
<p>We're working on eventually having that, but we're really focused on the content and less so on the presentation. So this tool. And you can continue to add your achievements and we recommend that you use it, but if you wanna keep it in a doc that works just as well. This is part of the free teal membership.</p>
<p>So now talking about a resume, this is a resume you're gonna deliver to a company or to a person, right? But this is gonna be a concise document that speaks to you and your qualifications. Let's talk about the main sections in the anatomy of a resume that the main sections are your contact information, your summary.</p>
<p>Your experience and your education, then you can include additional things like a skill section, interest, language, certifications, volunteering, awards, and publication, depending on how much space you have and how much experience you have, you really want to try to keep your resume from two to three pages.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask does it have to be one page? Does it have to be three page? my advice I always give is if your first page doesn't hook them, it doesn't matter how many pages your resume is. The first page has to be stellar and has to get people excited about you. And then if they think that's great, they'll read five pages, but they're not just gonna rule you out because it's too many pages.</p>
<p>So I think no matter what the first page has to be amazing. And it matters a little bit less. If you've got 2, 3, 4 pages. So we wanna make sure you hit the high notes on the first. Your re your resume is your pitch, right? It shows how you are the solution to their problems. We talked in the previous section about the JD.</p>
<p>The resume is the tailored response to that request for information, or that request for a proposal, they've said, they've got a problem. This document should show how you are the solution, which should in turn result in you getting an interview. And that's when you really get to talk about yourself and really make the pitch.</p>
<p>But this is a very tailor made document to respond to their problems. You don't get to be there and talk. So it's gotta be very edited and on point. And so don't think about all the amazing things you've ever. In the context of this situation. Those don't matter. I hate to say it because a lot of people have a lot of great achievements, but this company has said, we need this.</p>
<p>And so you've gotta show, I know how to do this. So the resume is gonna you again, you wanna keep it tight if you can get it to one page. Amazing. But don't beat yourself up too much. If you can. Like I said, it's most important that the first page be amazing. And at the first page, and even I'll talk about it in a second.</p>
<p>The top third be amazing, right? Statistically or from research and the research that's been done with recruiters and the people that look at resumes. The general metric that people use is six seconds. That's how long someone looks at a resume. Six seconds could feel a while, like a little while when you sit there and count it out, but it's really not.</p>
<p>And so what that tells you is they're not really reading it, they're skimming it. And what people generally do when they skim is they go from the top left to the bottom. And we'll talk about that in a second, but they're just doing it quickly again, generally six seconds, five to 10 seconds. And what they're doing is they're skimming for keyword.</p>
<p>What are those keywords? If I'm a recruiter and someone told me, Hey, the person needs to know Salesforce marketing cloud. That's what I'm looking for. The person has to have deployed a CRM. That's what I'm looking. So that's why the keyword are so important. And then we talk about this upper third, right?</p>
<p>If you've watched a res recruiter do this before, sometimes they'll print a stack and they'll just kinda flip through them. They're looking at that top of the paper. Now, a lot of people use PDFs, but still they start at the top. If you don't hook them in that top third, they're not even gonna go to the bottom.</p>
<p>So that top third's really important. And again, if I can't stress it keywords, think about the times you skim. That's what people are doing. They're just skimming. They're looking for keywords. And generally what they do is they look at the top, they go down the left and look at the names of the companies.</p>
<p>Then they'll look at your time, they'll look at the titles and then they'll go to the achievements. But before they do all that, they read the top. So you wanna make sure that those keywords are in there and just in case I didn't make it clear. Just wanna be sure keywords I can't stress this enough keywords.</p>
<p>Really what you want in there. Again, people are skimming and another important part before they even skim is that they're using technology called an applicant tracking system to search for these words. They're not as fancy as people make it out to be. It's not some sort of complex AI doing really incredible things.</p>
<p>It's usually very explicit, simple. What's called bullion search. The recruiter or the person filtering through say there's 500 resumes and they wanna get it down to 50 so that they can actually read those by hand. They will type in the word Salesforce and it'll return all the resumes that have the word Salesforce in it.</p>
<p>And so that's why the keyword are so important. And you wanna be mindful of what are the things that the company is saying are most, I. When they post that job because when they search for those terms, again, it's not doing some sort of crazy recommendation AI, it's just searching for those terms.</p>
<p>And so you wanna make sure that those terms are in your resume. All right. Let's think about how people read them. You made it past the ATS you keywords were in there. They read from the top left to the bottom, right? At least in we're really focused on English here. Other languages might be.</p>
<p>Right to left, but in this case, we're talking about an English resume a Western resume and it's from the top left to the bottom. And that's kinda how we skim. So think about that. What information is there and what is the least important at the bottom and what are those areas that aren't just gonna be looked at as much?</p>
<p>So think about the composition and again, that top third, that's your opportunity to pitch and get them hooked, right? If they're not into you and connected on that top. , they're not gonna go below into the content. They're not even gonna read it. Keeping that really concise. And then that blurb, that pitch that talks about the entirety of your career is critical and then the details of your career.</p>
<p>All right. Let's talk about each section. Sometimes we'll see people take too much space for their introduction. They'll put their name and then align and then align for each of the information we like to just keep it simple across the. What do they wanna see my name, where I'm at email, I'll get the other stuff.</p>
<p>If I wanted really compress that down. So we like the single line then straight to the blurb. The other thing we like right above the blurb is the title you are applying for, because if they do a search they're gonna search for the title that they're hiring for. And one of the things, if you've never had the title, then it's not gonna show up on your resume.</p>
<p>So this is an opportunity for you to put in. That is not a lie, but is what you are applying for. It makes sense. And so you can put that title that you are applying for. We highly recommend that you put in there, the title that exactly in the same words that they have posted it right there. So if you're gonna do one customization only.</p>
<p>That's the one next is the experience and there's different formats of resumes. We strongly encourage you to do standard chronological resume. A lot of people wanna format and try different things. Oftentimes it stands out for a bad reason. People will say, what's this person trying to hide what's going on?</p>
<p>Why are they leaving information out? So the more you can do a chronological resume, the. All right. So what that means is that the last job you had is at the top. And the job you had a long time ago is at the bottom. So you wanna start with your most recent job, whether there, or previously at the top, and a few things we call out for here, you wanna list out the various roles you had, but we recommend against putting the dates per role.</p>
<p>Cuz one of the things that recruiters do is they look at the company, the role, and then they go straight to the right to the time. They may not realize that those were all within the same company and you run the risk of coming off as job hobby. So we strongly recommend that you do your start and end date at the company.</p>
<p>The exception to that is if you've been at the same company for a very long time, I would say. Five to 10 years and you want to show your Ascension within that time, then it may be worth it because you want to show that you progressed and you didn't just stay stagnant. So that would be a reason you wouldn't do it.</p>
<p>But if anything, under five years, we recommend that you do it because then it might look like you change jobs every year. And you didn't, you were moving within one company. So that's why we recommend start and end date of the company. The other thing is we include, we recommend month in year when you leave off the.</p>
<p>You're trying to leave something out. Remember recruiters are looking at these hundreds of them a day. They'll see that's something fishy. You're clearly leaving it out for a reason. So unless you have a really good reason month and year. All right. And then your achievements, that first job, the one that you're in or you most recently had that's by far the most important cuz that's the freshest.</p>
<p>So you can go a little bit bigger there, maybe a total of three to seven bullets, but then jobs after. Be mindful of not to put too many, I would say three to five. And the further you go, the smaller, cuz that was really a long time ago. And they're just not gonna give you as much credit for it.</p>
<p>Now, remember go back to the JD and look at those keywords that they used. If you're gonna really invest in doing a customized resume, do this work. The, this is where the company is telling you. These are the things we wanna see in here. The hard skills, the soft skills, the actions they want you to. So you're gonna take that information and you're gonna plug it into your achievements.</p>
<p>And one of the biggest mistakes people make on writing that part of the resume is they just do it very descriptively. They just talk about what their day to day responsibilities were the day to day tasks they were doing. And that's uninteresting. It doesn't prove that you have the ability to take on this role and it doesn't in any way, give them confidence in hiring you for it.</p>
<p>So something like worked with the tech team to increase web. That's not good or it's even worse. I've seen people just say worked on the company website that doesn't help at all. You wanna build good, robust achievements that empirically prove that you've done this right. We go into deep detail in the personal branding class on how to cover that.</p>
<p>But here, we're gonna talk about it lightly because we wanna make sure that you take these things into account. As you are building out your achieve. so you wanna include measurable metrics in your achievements, and you wanna show that you've done this. And so the way you do that is you stick to this very simple formula, a success verb, or a positive verb, a noun.</p>
<p>What was that thing that I affected the metric and the outcome? What was the positive outcome from this work that you did within the. So here's an example. I grew engagement by 200%, which led to doubled revenue in three months. So success, verb. I grew that's good. Success verb could also be reduced cause I saved money.</p>
<p>Depending on the role you're applying for, what was it? Engagement that was important to the business, by how much? 200% that's significant, which led to a doubling of revenue in three months. , this is a person I want on my team. This is a person that knows how to talk about success. Who knows how to talk about achievement and can give me specific metrics that can prove they did this.</p>
<p>And now I want to interview this person and I want to talk about it. I want to ask questions about this and now I can give lots of color. So just this very simple little statement can say a lot about what you're capable of doing. So remember. The better your achievement, the more it proves you have these abilities and you wanna get those metrics in there.</p>
<p>Metrics are memorable. You remember numbers. There's a reason that they put big numbers in the news and they put big numbers. When they're talking about successes or streaks numbers are memorable. and they prove that you have the ability because it gives some meat to the statement you're making that, you know how to do this, and that's gonna be a great conversation when they bring you in for the interview.</p>
<p>It also shows that you know how to talk about yourself in this empirical way, which is in and of itself a great ability. It. All right. So here's some examples we can look at. If you do planning of events, you can say organized and sold out a charity event, 300 people for half a million dollars. I want that person, you know how to do it because when I do events, that's the kind of outcomes I want.</p>
<p>I don't wanna know that you just know how to plan events. I wanna know how you plan successful events that drive business outcomes. And you can see that we won't read all of these, cuz you can pause the video and watch them. Training, oftentimes people will say the thing I did or the work that I.</p>
<p>it's not measurable, not true. It's all measurable. Cuz ultimately businesses are measurable and they must be measured. They gotta make money. They gotta save. . And so the work you are doing, someone had an intuition on how it made the business better and better you are at articulating that the better.</p>
<p>So no, let's take a training on why do companies run training? Cuz they wanna save money. If people are better at things, then they'll be more efficient or they'll do it better or customers will be happier. So in this case, conducted compliance training for a hundred plus managers, virtual. right now, I'm showing that I know how to do it with the times.</p>
<p>It wasn't in person at five locations that reduce company costs by 50. okay. I want you to do my training at my company cuz you understand how it was effective. And when you did the training, you measured it. Now one thing people will ask us all the time is how accurate do the numbers need to be? It's okay if you're directional here, right?</p>
<p>No one's gonna go audit it. No, one's gonna check and no one's gonna check like to the decimal place. So it's okay for you to take a little bit of Liberty with what you think the outcome was now don't flat out lie and don't flat out. Make it. . But if you know that, certain amount of things were happening and they generally went down by half, you should be very confident saying something like this, right?</p>
<p>So here's an example. The job posting says, manage a team of nine and determine team strategy, priorities, and goal, right? That's what's in the JD. I might have had a bullet in my master resume or in my previous resume that said something like lead a team of marketing associates and grew that number of engagement 90% in 12 months.</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and change that to managed a team, right? Cuz they're using the word manage. So when they're skimming, they're looking for the word manage, a team of five, they said nine, but I did five. So that still counts. I don't wanna lie and make up things that I haven't done.</p>
<p>And then I did oversee the strategy, priorities and goals. I took their exact language and I put it in right where it fit. So the more you. Adapt to their language, the better. And I know it might feel like a lot of work, but your outcomes will be significantly better. It's absolutely worth. All right in the master resume builder we have this achievement wizard.</p>
<p>It should help you write achievements. And the goal is for it to guide you along with how to do it. And it gives you a framing of the different categories and the different verbs. And it should really streamline the process. There. There's plenty of videos on the platform on how to use it, and we cover it in depth in the building, your personal brand class. So if you want, now you can pop over and watch it. All </p>
<p>The next section is your education and your skills, right? These are opportunities to put in more keywords, your education. You wanna go ahead and put in all your degrees. Cause oftentimes they're required. So you wanna make sure you did that, but unless there's additional information about those topics you studied, you wanna keep it pretty minimal.</p>
<p>Maybe, if you're early in your career, that might matter a little bit more, cuz you're looking to get some more substance into the resume. But if you're a little later in your career, five years plus it's not gonna matter as much that they're really gonna focus on what you've done and what you've achieved professionally, then there's the skills and additional information.</p>
<p>And this is. Something we took from the latters mark Candela's book recommends it. And I really think it's a great suggest. is this to just put it all together. A lot of times people break it out in like hard skills, soft skills certificate certificates. It doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>And no one's really doing that, looking at it in that way. And it takes a tremendous amount of space. So given the importance of getting those words onto this document so that the ATS can find it. We like a paragraph of comma separated terms. Now I'd put. Together, right? So at the end here, we've got writing and photography.</p>
<p>Those would be more in the interest category. So don't mix and match interest and skills. Maybe you wanna do one line for each one if you wanna cluster them together. But we strongly recommend just the comma separated list of terms, cuz those are gonna be great to put in keywords and fill in terms that you weren't able to get in into the achievement or into your blurb, but were listed on the JD.</p>
<p>So really powerful area. Might seem like trivial and something you just throw in at the end, but actually incredibly powerful for the keyword matching. All right. And when it all comes together, you should have this document it's crisp, it's clean, this template is available on the teal platform.</p>
<p>It's a very simple template. What it's trying to do is use weight of text that goes naturally to where people look. The first thing they do is they look at your. the title you're applying for. So you're conveying, this is the job I want. They will then go to the companies. What are all the companies you've worked at?</p>
<p>They will then go to your tenure and then they will look at the titles. And that's exactly what we've done with the waitings of the font here naturally takes your eye there and then they go to the achievements. All right. So think about that. There's tons of great templates online. But the most important takeaway here is be.</p>
<p>Deliberate with your space. Don't try to cram a whole bunch of words on there. The, if you can edit this and make it crisp and tight, that says more than just loading up the document with the size eight font with no spacing, because you're trying to comply to the one page. Too many people we've seen get obsessed with the one page thing I would say, make the first page incredible.</p>
<p>That's the most important thing. So get that blurb to be on point. That first job you had to get really ex excited. and then I promise you, they will turn the page and look at the second and look at the third. But if the first page stinks, doesn't matter. If your resume is only one page, you're not gonna get called back for an interview. So make sure that this first page is incredible</p>
<p>in this section, we're gonna talk about cover letters and references, and these are, oftentimes asked for, but not always. So it's a little bit of a conditional and they may come a little later in the process. So a cover letter allows you to craft a narrative that aligns Bo both with you and the position.</p>
<p>And it might allow you to give a little bit more color than you would have in your resume. And it also can happen in a couple different ways. It might be in an email itself. It might be a separate document and some companies explicitly require cover letters. Now, if they don't and you submit. from what we've seen from our interviewing with recruiters is that there is a very low likelihood that it will be read.</p>
<p>But that said, if you submit one, make it really good, because if it's generic and they read it, they can tell and they don't like it. So if it's required, you gotta do it. If it's not required, we recommend that you don't do it. But if you do tailor it and make it specific to the role, don't just copy paste.</p>
<p>Cuz people can tell. All right. So a few things to think about when you're putting together your cover letter, if it's required again, do it no, take note if it's required or optional, if it's optional. Strongly recommend that you don't do it. It's an opportunity for you to make your case.</p>
<p>And there are times when it's really helpful. If you're making a career pivot or a career transition, you can give a little bit more color, right? If there's some gaps on your resume and some things that maybe don't come through as cleanly on just a resume format, your cover letter is your chance to do it right when not to do it, if it doesn't explicitly ask for it, definitely don't do it.</p>
<p>If it's optional, we don't recommend that you do it. A lot of companies don't read them. So if you're gonna do it again, do it well, what to include in a cover letter, we've got a template on the teal platform, right? In the PDF for this presentation. There's a link to it. So we recommend that you use that if it's helpful again, there's lots of great templates online but things that you wanna do, be specific and show that you've researched the.</p>
<p>Again, don't make it generic. People can tell they don't like it. They like to see that you've put in the work, share your blurb in relationship to the JD. So this might be a time to do a little bit more tailoring focus on those key points and key words and how you bring value to the role and be concise.</p>
<p>Definitely keep it to one page, and don't use the whole page, two to three paragraphs max. So be concise. Don't use a generic cover letter. Do not copy paste. People can. Promise you, they can tell they read it and they hate it. Don't rehash your resume, make it unique and different. Don't just copy paste the same information, absolutely critical triple check, your grammar and your spelling.</p>
<p>It is unfortunately as someone who's a bad speller and really bad at grammar, but it is a massive red. People look at it and they do not take lightly to typos and errors. It just shows disregard. And they're gonna assume that's what you're gonna bring to the job. So be super mindful of it. If it's someone, if you're someone like me, who struggles with it, have people look at it on your behalf, use a tool like Grammarly.</p>
<p>There's lots of great ways to get there's. There's no excuse to not do it. And don't use to whom it may concern. It shows that you didn't do your research and you don't put it in the time. And. Address it to a person look up who the hiring manager is, look up, who it reports to, be mindful of that and be specific show that you did the work.</p>
<p>Now, switching over to references. References are super important. And you want to think about these as career capital, taking a line from Cal Newport who coined the phrase. Don't just wait till the last minute. When the company asks them, asks you for them, cuz you're not gonna get good ones and they're not gonna be strategic references can be incredibly.</p>
<p>All right. So think in advance, always be tailoring, but if you are thinking about making a leap within your company or to a new role, start to think about who are the people that can help you do that. So build out a list of people, sometimes they might know exactly who the person is, but oftentimes not.</p>
<p>So what they're gonna do is they're gonna look at the companies that they worked at and their titles. So you wanna be able to draft off of that. So executives, VPs, directors, manager. look for titles that would carry weight and mean something. All right. Then you are going to reach out in advance and ask for them, right?</p>
<p>You're gonna give people a little bit of context and what you're doing and why you need it. you're gonna then develop your final list, cuz some may not get back to you. Some say they might be too busy. Most will probably say yes. And then you will give your final ask and then you will follow up with when you need it.</p>
<p>The last thing you want is to be deep into a hiring process. A company says we need three references and you're scrambling, worse cases. You list three people. They actually called them and you never gave them a heads. They'll probably do the kind thing, but be much more deliberate, right?</p>
<p>You're gonna call them and say, Hey, I'm applying for this position. This is what they're looking for. I would love it. If you would say this, there's nothing wrong with that. It's you being strategic and architecting the process to get the outcome that you want. So there's the initial ask and we've all these templates are available to you within the platform.</p>
<p>So you can copy paste them and modify them and put them in a tone or language that suits you. But you wanna make that initial ask, let them know you're, ask how they're doing connect and then make that ask and give them some context of what you're applying for. Then you're gonna build up your reference list.</p>
<p>This template is available on the. Do it in a spreadsheet, but you want this list of references and you wanna maintain this. This is a document you're gonna curate over the course of your career. It's really important. Have their contact information, all the things you're gonna need.</p>
<p>So you don't scramble. So you're not, you don't find yourself scrambling for it. All right, then you're gonna make the final ask. Make it super easy for. I don't want to do a ton of work to be a reference, right? Just make it real easy. Say, look, this is the stuff that needs to be covered. Here's the things that I've told them were my achievements.</p>
<p>These are the talking points that I used, please, feel free to use these. You're not cheating. You're not doing anything disingenuous. You're actually making it easier on them. People wanna be a reference and they wanna help you. But and to help you the more you help them help you, the more they'll be able to do it.</p>
<p>So the key thing here. The people that you've asked to be references, make it easy on them. Don't make it stressful. Don't make them dread taking the time to do it, be mindful of that and wrap it up nice and easy for them. All right. And with that, you'll get great references. That'll really help you land that next job.</p>
<p>All right. So that was the customizing your resume class and thinking about how you present. A tailored version of you to that JD again, remember companies have a problem. You need to be the solution. They need to see your materials and say, this is the person who checks all the boxes on all the things that we need to solve.</p>
<p>And that's really what you're solving for. Can stress this enough. The resume's job is not to get you the job. The resume's job is to get you in the. Once you're in the door, then you're gonna interview and you're gonna use all the interviewing tactics that we recommend to land the job. But the resume's job is to get you in the door.</p>
<p>And what's the invitation in the job description. The job description says, these are all the things we want. And the resume says, this is all the ways that I know how to do those. Be mindful of it. I know it's a lot of work, but it's how you're gonna get the best outcomes.</p>
